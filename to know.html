         <div>
         <p>Howdy! I’m Colin Wright.</p>
         <p>I’m an author, podcast host, and generalist maker-of-things.</p>
         <p>I also <a href="" class="new-link"> speak </a> to audiences worldwide at conferences, universities, and on the 
             periodic national or international tour.
            </p>
         <p>I spend most of my time learning, making things that I hope will be of value, and 
                 striving to grow as a person—in terms of physical and mental health, knowledge, 
                  resiliency, and overall capability.
         </p>
         <p>
            I’ve been traveling the world full-time since 2009, and for most of that time I had
             my readers vote on what country I would move to next every four months or so.
         </p>
         <p>
            For the past few years I’ve experimented with different models, including spending 
             time in unfamiliar parts of the US, fixing up and full-timing in a vintage RV (while 
              on tour), and at the moment, researching and visiting potential home bases to use 
               as jumping-off points for future travels.

         <h4>Somewhat More Information</h4>
            <p>I’m originally from Northern California, but I grew up in Columbia, Missouri.</p>
          <p>
            Growing up, I couldn’t decide if I wanted to be a chaos theorist (I was better at 
             math back then) or comic book illustrator; I ultimately pursued a combined 
              journalism and fine arts trajectory in high school.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked a handful of design- and technology-related jobs alongside my classes at 
             university, and wrote news analysis columns for local newspapers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my first business, a magazine, when I was 19 and still in school. The project 
             went well, then flopped, which was very painful and educational. I graduated with 
              a dual-emphasis degree in graphic design and illustration, then moved out to LA to 
               work as a generalist “creative” at a small production and design agency.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a year, I left the studio job to start up my own one-person operation, at first 
             doing an array of design, web, animation, and interactive work, before finding a 
              niche in broader-based branding projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things were going very well, business-wise, when I realized that I was sacrificing
             essentially every other aspect of my life to achieve that success.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2009, I handed off most of my clients, sold or gave away everything I owned that 
             wouldn’t fit into carry-on luggage, and started up a blog, Exile Lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the years since, I’ve lived in Argentina, New Zealand, Thailand, Iceland, India, 
             Romania, Czech Republic, and the Philippines, visited about 60 other countries 
              and all 48 contiguous US states (twice), roadtripped South America, wandered 
               Southeast Asia, explored Europe by train, and enjoyed many other travel-related 
                adventures.

          <h4>Yet More Information</h4>
          <p>
            I’m fortunate to have a wonderful family. My parents live in central Missouri and 
             my three siblings are scattered around the US. I have quite a few fur-nieces and fur- 
              nephews.
          </p>
          <p>
            I make friends and build relationships of different kinds as I travel: I have some 
             truly amazing and inspiring people in my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m a minimalist in that I own few things and am intentional in how I consume. 
             This doesn’t mean I’m anti-consumption, but rather that I’m careful about how I 
              spend my time, energy, and resources (including money). I tend to buy less but 
               invest in quality, and I aim for the same in relationships, the work I do, and 
                everything else.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m 35-years-old, left-handed, and cannot believe I get to do what I do for a living.

          <h4>FAQ</h4>
         <p>If you don’t see an answer to your question below, feel free to contact me.</p>
         <h4 class="heading-4">How can I do what you do? Traveling is my dream!</h4>
         <p>
            Great! There are many ways to travel long-term or full-time. As many ways as there 
             are people, in fact.
         </p>
         <p>A few things to be thinking about:</p>
         <p>
            1. What do you want to get out of travel? What do you hope to achieve by living in 
             this way?
         </p>
         <p>
            2. How might you earn an income while on the road? What skills do you possess 
             that might allow you to work independently or remotely, and what skills might you 
              acquire that would help you do so?
         </p>
         <p>
            3. What elements of your comfort zone will need to be taken into account when 
             figuring out expenses, locations, methods of travel, and other such considerations? 
              Are you comfortable being uncomfortable, or will you need a large cozy bed and a 
               first class plane ticket everywhere you go? There’s nothing wrong with needing such 
                things, but it’s important to be aware of these preferences and needs, as you’ll want 
                 to work this information into your plans.
         </p>
         <p>
            4. It’s also important to consider the ethical implications of your travels, including 
             the emissions created by various travel methods, and the damage that can be 
              caused by visitors to landmarks, cities, and natural settings. This damage can 
               include things like the transmission of diseases, but also general wear-and-tear on 
                plants, paths, and architecture, alongside potential economic recalibrations that 
                 can ruin an area for locals as it becomes more accessible by visitors.
         </p>
         <p>
            Focus on what’s vital, make sure you know why you’re doing it, and make sure it’s 
             sustainable: economically, but also psychologically and physically.
         </p>
         <p>
            From there, it’s a good idea to set a deadline and to use the time leading up to that 
             deadline as a runway before take-off. Don’t rush, but don’t put it off forever, either.
         </p>
         <p>
            Then go out into the world, try to leave places and people you encounter better than 
             you found them, and do your best to be present for the experiences you have along 
              the way.
         </p>
         <h4 class="heading-4">Do you accept guest posts/submissions for your blog?</h4>
        <p>Nope, sorry.</p>
        <h4class="heading-4">Why not?</h4>
        <p>
            It’s just not how I use this space. Back when I first started blogging I accepted a few, 
             but not anymore. The blogosphere was a very different creature back then, and so 
              was I.
        </p>
        <h4 class="heading-4">Can I buy an advertisement on your blog?</h4>
        <p>Nope, sorry.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-4">Wait, if you don’t display ads like a smart business person, how do you make 
             money from your blog?</h4>
             <p>The short answer is: I don’t.</p>
             <p>The longer and more complete answer is: I don’t make money directly from my 
                 blog, but it serves as a means of communicating with my audience, who are able to 
                  get a taste for my work, and who may, as a result, decide to pick up one of my books, 
                   attend a conference at which I’m speaking, or support my podcast.
                </p>
                <p>It’s a slow-burn means of making a living, but it’s one I feel good about. I wouldn’t be able to say the same if I bombarded folks with marketing messages or overwhelmed them with blinking ads, promoting widgets they don’t need.
                </p>
                <h4 class="heading-4">Will you come speak at my conference/event/school/business?</h4>
                <p>Perhaps! <a href="" class="new-link"> Here’s some info about hiring me as a speaker and how that all works.</a></p>
                <h4 class="heading-4">Aren’t you a minimalist? Isn’t it counter to your philosophy to sell books?</h4>
                <p>Nope. Being a minimalist doesn’t mean owning nothing, it means owning exactly <br>
                     the right things for one’s needs and priorities. It’s not about being anti-consumption, it’s about being anti- <br>
                      compulsory consumption.
                </p>
                <p>I try to only own things that add value and happiness to my life. There are many <br>
                         other things I could own that would only weigh me down or consume resources <br>
                          (time, energy, money) that I could instead spend on truly valuable things (‘valuable’ <br>
                           being defined by my needs and priorities).
                 </p>
                 <p>If a book brings you joy, helps you learn, or exposes you to new ideas, there’s a good <br>
                     chance it passes muster, minimalism-wise. Though that won’t be the case for <br>
                      everyone—if your money is better spent on something else according to your <br>
                       standards, please do that, instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also encourage folks who buy my books to hand them off to a friend or donate <br>
                         them to a library afterward, which is a good way to enjoy the benefits of a tangible <br>
                          book without adding any clutter to your life.
                    </p>
                          <h4 class="heading-4">How do I write a book?</h4>
                    <p>The first step is to start writing. A <i>lot.</i></p>
                    <p>Many people want to write a book but don’t write, or are afraid to start writing <br>
                             before they feel they have the entire publishing scaffolding in place.</p>
                    <p>Don’t do that. Don’t wait for permission.</p>
                    <p>Get started, write all the time. It’s the only way to get better, and it’s the best <br>
                     possible way to sound more like yourself and develop your personal style.</p>
